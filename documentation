1. Base color both in Hexadecimal & in color name format – Base color refers to the color in
the center of the image – seen as the pixelwise center
Base color - done
Need to build the database parsed wikipedia link below to obtain the data - done
map hex color and color name format from this and print the relevant base color in hex and name - pending

2. Gradient, Hue, Saturation
- Gradient - done (comes up as a window popup) - instead of that need to save the image drawn in matplot lib into the file
- saturation / hue - same as above.

3. Identify if any text is present – and read that text
- text mining via tesseract - accuracy missing for some images

4. Background color both in Hexadecimal & in color name format
- done . need to map to the db in step 1.
- Query: is background color, dominant color of the image ?

5. An average color of the image (see also “avaerage color of an image”)
- calculated the average of all pixels 
- need to corelate against database

This link was used for parsing the data for mapping db in database:
